# Let's make parental leaves at UBC more equitable.

UBC faculty who become parents by surrogacy or by adoption do not enjoy the same benefits as faculty who are traditional mothers. 

We ([Nancy Heckman](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/nancy-e-heckman) and [Vincenzo Coia](https://vincenzocoia.com)) are spearheading an initiative to make parental leaves at UBC more equitable. We've spoken with various branches of UBC leadership about the issues, and they are generally supportive in principle. We will be working with the Faculty Association to make this a part of the Collective Agreement process, which starts up in the fall.
